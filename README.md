# expensify
A very common and simple React application to manage expenses to use more advanced features of React such as authentication, routing, testing and deploying.

## dev tools

- For react, I simply use Chrome React Developer Tools extension.

- For Redux, I use https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension

## env files

You can always check `.env.example` file to see which env variables you need.
- Create env files in root directory or modify your scripts to run them properly.
- Create `.env.test` file to setup env variables for tests.
- Create `.env.development` file to setup env variables for development server and database.
